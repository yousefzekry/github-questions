Basic Git Questions:

1. What is a git repository?
-Git is a version control system used in software development to track changes in any software files.

-Repository in Git is a place where Git stores all the files. Git can store the files either
on the local repository or on the remote repository.



2. What is "git init", "git commit", "Git add"?

- Git init is used to initialize a new git repository
- Git commit saves changes in our local repository
- " Git add " command is used to add files to git to be watched for changes 
-The git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area.
we may use "git add ." command to add all files in the file path we are using
or we can use "git add <filename>" 



3. What does git push commands do?

-The git push command is used to upload local 
repository content to a remote repository.


4. What's the difference between git fetch and git pull?

-The git fetch command downloads commits, files,
and refs from a remote repository into your local repo. 
Fetching is what you do when you want to see what everybody 
else has been working on. 

This makes fetching a safe way to review
commits before integrating them with your local repository.


5. What is a git merge conflict and how does it happen? How to resolve it?

-   when changes are written in the same line in two different branches we are trying to merge.
-   merge conflict happens because the git doesn't know which one of them we want to chose.

-   1-use 'git merge --abort' to cancel the merge.
-   2-use 'git diff' helps to identify the differences between the states repositories or files.
-   3-use 'git reset' The git reset command is used at the time of merge conflict to reset the conflicted files to their original state.


6. What is the head, working tree, and index?


-   HEAD refers to the currently checked-out branch's latest commit.
    for example: 
    this is the the head of branch I am currently in ==> commit 79365d5f6283e278bc7ad5f1145a26ad2c0fe68f (HEAD -> myNewBranch, origin/myNewBranch)

    -working tree It represents the current state of your project on your local machine. 
    When you modify files in the working tree, Git tracks the changes and stages them for the next commit.

    -Index temporary staging area for changes that you want to include in the next commit. 
    When you modify a file in the working tree, Git adds the changes to the index by using the 'git add' command.


7. Explain these commands one by one â€“ git status, git log, git diff, git revert <commit>, git reset <file>?

    -'git status' displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't, 
      and which files aren't being tracked by Git.
    
    -'git log' a utility tool to review and read a history of everything that happens to a repository


    -'git diff'Show changes between the working tree and the index or a tree, 
      changes between the index and a tree, 
      changes between two trees, changes resulting from a merge, 
      changes between two blob objects, or changes between two files on disk.


8. What is git clone?


-git clone simply downloads the git repository to your local machine


9. What is git stash?

-'git stash' is used for drafting our work without commiting it 
-for example we want to work on two different features in our project, starting by working on feature one before we finish it 
 we wanted to work on {feature 2} first because it needs to be submitted as soon as possible at the same time we don't want to
 lose the progress we made in {feature 1} then its time for 'git stash' it will draft the progress without commiting it 
 -let's apply same scenario if we added {feature 3} after we made progress to {feature 2} then we will use git stash again
 -whenever we want to revert back to any stash we will use command 'git stash list' then choose the number of want
 -if we want to use the first stash we will use 'git stash apply'    



10. What is git reset and mention different ways to use it and what each way does?


-it resets the state of our working tree and staging area to latest commit

 types of 'git reset'
    'git reset --hard' <commit> : resets the HEAD pointer to a previous commit and updates the staging area and 
                                  working tree to match the state of the commit. 
                                  This effectively discards all changes made since the commit

    'git reset --soft' <commit> :  resets the HEAD pointer to a previous commit, 
                                   but leaves the changes in the working tree and staging area intact. 
                                   This is useful if you want to "undo" a commit and make further changes before committing again.

    git reset --mixed <commit>: This command resets the HEAD pointer to a 
                                previous commit and updates 
                                the staging area to match the state of the commit, 
                                but leaves the changes in the working tree intact. 
                                This is useful if you want to unstage changes that you previously staged.

11. What does the git squash do?


-is a feature in Git that allows you to combine multiple commits into a single, cleaner commit. 
 This is useful for creating a more organized commit history and making it easier to understand 
 the changes that were made to a codebase.


12. What does git merge do in basic steps of commands?


-'git checkout' will show us which which branch are we working on 
-'git branch -a' will list for us the branches we have for this git repo
-'git checkout <branchname>' we will use this command only to move to another branch if we want to make the merge 
-on another we have to move to it first 
-'git merge <branchname>' The git merge command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.

13. What does git annotate command do?


-'git annotate <filename>' that allows you to see who made changes to a file and when those changes were made. 
It displays the revision and author information for each line in a file, 
allowing you to track the evolution of the file over time and see who made each change.


14. What is a pull request?


-lets say i have updated features in a new branch for this project and want to ask my supervisor 
-if this changes are valid or not
-after creating this new branch i will create a pull request which allows other team members to review the changes, 
-provide feedback, and suggest additional changes. 


15. What is git cherry-pick?

-is a Git command that allows you to apply a specific commit from one branch to another branch. 
-It is commonly used when you want to apply a specific change from one branch to another, 
-without merging the entire branch.
