Basic Git Questions:

1. What is a git repository?
- Git is a version control system used in software development to track changes in any software files.

-Repository in Git is a place where Git stores all the files. Git can store the files either
on the local repository or on the remote repository.

2. What is "git init", "git commit", "Git add"?
- The first step is to use git init which initializes a git working directory for the project and creates the .git hidden folder.
- The next step is to make changes or have already made changes.
- So far the changed files are not staged (meaning they are not added to the staging area)
    - The staging area is the area which the files are placed that are ready to be committed, meaning if you place a file here and commit these files will be written in the commit.
- We use the git add <filename> the filename can be the relative path of the file to the working directory and we can add multiple files
- Or we can use git add . or git add * to add all the files that are currently located in the working directory to the staging area
- Last step is to use the git commit commmand which prompts us to create a commit with a header and a body and you can write a description for what happened in this commmit.
    - This moves the files from the staging area to the commit we just did and if you use git status, you will find that the files that were in the staging area are now gone.
